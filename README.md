# SpeakingPictures

## Introduction
This program takes an image from the user's smartphone and when a section of that image is pressed, an audio recording begins. When the finger is released, the recording stops and a red rectangle appears, which indicates a region with an attached recording. 
## Project Purpose
One possible use is child education - the parent takes a picture of an object and records the name of that object. Later, the child can tap on any of the objects with a recording and hear the pronounciation without further parent input. It is also a very fun activity for children (albeit for only several minutes). The actual purpose of this project is for me to see if I can create a functional mobile app.
## Design setbacks
Not feasible to recalculate the rectangle area position for different smartphone screen resolution when the picture and its audio files are moved to another smartphone, or when transitioning from portrait to landscape mode. Due to this main issue there are currently no similar popular projects.
## Current Status 
The app is usable, but unstable, as it is not finished. Due to the design setbacks mentioned above, the current status of the project is: frozen.
